# ABOUT #

This is a compiler for the E+ programming language.
The compiler is implemented in C++ and compiles the code down to assembly language.
From the assembly it generates object code.

To build the compiler you need a C++17 compatible compiler.

# SUPPORTED OBJECT CODE FORMATS #
  -  PE/COFF

# WINDOWS SETUP #

The following must be set in PATH:

Disable Anti virus for the exe.

# TESTED ON #
